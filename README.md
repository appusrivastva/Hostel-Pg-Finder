<!-- Project title is Accommodation Finder -->

Problem Statement:  As a student or an outsider, it is very difficult to search a place for accommodation manually in unknown city where we do not know anyone or do not have idea of  that city. We need to ask individuals or might be visit many places in search of a good Hostel of PG. This is a very tarry and boring task. Also, it is very difficult for Hostel and PG owner to promote their business manually .For promotion of their business they also need a global platform where they can show their services. To increase their client, they should have a platform to promote themselves.
 To overcome these types of problems from both ends, this portal comes into existence.


 Proposed System: In this system we will develop a web portal where all types of owners    will do registration to show their accommodation details and services. User can search        these details and communicate with them and book them online.

It will be a very useful platform for everyone who wants to search Hostels and PGs without wondering here and there.
